# tortoise-scripts
extra stuff for efficiency

don't bother trying to cut video segments, or transcribe long audios, do it on the fly from your speakers, one keybinding away  
dependencies: linux, pipewire, ffmpeg, whisper  

the entry point is: tortoise_bash.sh  
in particular, a simple script that allows you to transcribe what you are hearing (speakers_stt.sh)
